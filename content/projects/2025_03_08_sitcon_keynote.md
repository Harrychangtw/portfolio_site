## Project Overview

This portfolio website was designed and developed to showcase my projects and photography in a clean, modern interface. The site uses a custom markdown-based content management system that allows for easy updates without the need for a traditional CMS or database.

## The Challenge

Creating a portfolio that could showcase both design projects and photography while maintaining a consistent aesthetic and user experience. The content needed to be easily manageable without requiring complex database setups or expensive CMS solutions.

## The Approach

I decided to build a system that uses markdown files for content management. This approach allows:

1. **Simple Content Updates**: Adding new projects or gallery items is as simple as creating a new markdown file.
2. **Version Control**: All content changes can be tracked with Git.
3. **Flexible Content Structure**: Each entry can have custom metadata specific to its type (project or photo gallery).
4. **Fast Performance**: The static site generation capabilities of Next.js ensure optimal performance.

## The Solution

The website architecture includes:

- **Content Directories**: Separate folders for projects and gallery items
- **Markdown Processing**: Using gray-matter for front matter and remark for HTML conversion
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first layout that works on all devices
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js Image component for optimal loading performance
- **Dark Mode**: A dark theme that's easy on the eyes

## Results

The result is a fast, responsive portfolio that makes it easy to showcase both projects and photography. The content management system makes updating the site straightforward and efficient.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js for the framework
- React for the UI components
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Markdown for content
- Framer Motion for animations
