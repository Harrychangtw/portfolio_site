## How It Started

I was first introduced to SITCON, the biggest student-focused developer conference in Taiwan, by Andrew Kuo, who had given a [great talk on LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGgZTngrJB4) there himself. He encouraged me to pitch a full-length keynote about the **Chingshin RAG project**.

To be honest, I was hesitant at first. The thought of giving a 40-minute talk at a conference I'd never even been to was nerve-wracking. But looking back, I’m so glad I said yes. The experience wasn't just memorable—it was life-changing.

## Planning the Content

After the call-for-paper was accepted, the real work began in early February.

While I initially planned to focus only on the project, I decided it was more important to share the **"why" behind RAG** and break down the **core concepts of Retrieval-Augmented Generation**.

I structured the keynote around three key areas:

1.  **Three likely causes of model hallucinations**
2.  **Three main paradigms of RAG**
3.  **My experience building the Chingshin RAG**

This part was tricky. The internet is a mess of conflicting RAG implementations and naming schemes. I ended up grounding my entire explanation in a [**fantastic academic survey**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997) I found, which gave the talk a solid foundation.

With the concepts covered, it felt natural to transition into the story of how I built the **Chingshin RAG project**.

## Designing the Slides

The visual style for the keynote grew out of a **project pitch** I had previously designed from scratch for **GenAI Stars**.

I created more variety in the layouts and typography, using:
- **Source Han Serif** for body text
- **Langtinhei** for titles and headings

I designed everything in **Affinity Publisher 2**. I’m a big fan of it over Adobe’s tools for its one-time price and powerful, intuitive workflow.

Once the content was locked in, I brought the static designs to life:
- Each page was exported as a **3840×2160 PNG**.
- I layered and animated every single element in **Apple Keynote**.
- It was a slow, meticulous process, but the result was a presentation that felt dynamic and alive.

## Meeting the SITCON Community

The best part of the whole journey was the people. I met such a **passionate and supportive community** at SITCON.

You could feel their love for the event, especially during the practice sessions. The organizing committee gave me incredibly sharp and constructive feedback that truly shaped the final talk. It wouldn't have been half as good without them.

I’m so grateful for everyone who helped me along the way and made this such a meaningful and unforgettable experience.

## Acknowledgments

My sincere thanks to the SITCON 2025 organizing team, especially AK, Danny, and everyone who provided feedback during the practice sessions. Your support and encouragement made this keynote possible.
