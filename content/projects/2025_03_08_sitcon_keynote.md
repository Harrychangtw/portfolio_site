## Overview

SITCON is a biggest student-focused conference for those who love technology and programming. I was first introduced to SITCON by Andrew Kuo, who had once given a [presentation on LLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGgZTngrJB4) there. He later invited me to pitch the **Chingshin RAG project** as a full-length keynote.

Initially, I was reluctant—presenting a 40-minute-long speech at a conference I’d never attended felt daunting. But as time would tell, the experience turned out to be not only memorable but, dare I say, life-changing.

The complete keynote recording can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujxlUTXlC04) at SITCON's YouTube channel.

## Content Planning

After submitting the call-for-paper form, the real work of presentation design began in early February.

Although I originally wanted to share just the project, I chose to focus more on the **rationale behind building RAG** and the **core concepts of Retrieval-Augmented Generation**.

The keynote was structured to explore:

1. **Three possible causes of model hallucinations**
2. **Three main paradigms of RAG**
3. **Developing experience when building Chingshin RAG**

Planning this section was particularly challenging—the internet is filled with inconsistent implementations, categorizations, and naming conventions. To ground the content, I leaned heavily on a [**fantastic academic survey**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997) on RAG, which became the foundation of my explanation.

This conceptual overview then naturally flowed into sharing my own experiences building the **Chingshin RAG project**.

## Designing the Keynote

The keynote’s visual style evolved from the original **project pitch** I had designed from scratch for **GenAI Stars**.

I expanded the diversity of page layouts and typography:
- **Source Han Serif** for body text
- **Langtinhei** for titles and headings

Everything was designed in **Affinity Publisher 2**, which I prefer over Adobe’s offerings due to its affordability and powerful, intuitive tools.

After finalizing the content, each page was transformed into an animated keynote:
- Each static layout was exported into **3840×2160 PNGs**
- Every element was layered and animated in **Apple Keynote**
- This process was time-consuming but resulted in a dynamic, engaging presentation

## Meeting the SITCON Community

Perhaps the most memorable part of the journey was meeting a **community full of passionate, supportive people**.

Their love for hosting such an event was especially apparent during the **revision process**, where the organizing committee offered incredibly constructive feedback—without which the keynote wouldn't be what it is today.

I’m so grateful for everyone who was there along the way and helped shape such a meaningful and unforgettable experience.
