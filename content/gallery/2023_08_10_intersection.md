Where light and shadow meet, the city softly dissolves into dusk.

Some encounters are born from the unexpected, like this fleeting glance from a moving bus, a moment captured in a hurry, almost lost to time. The river holds the silent pulse of the city in its reflections. Above it, on the bridge, two separate journeys converge. They meet, they pass, two silhouettes against the fading gold of the sun.

The world held its breath. There was only the light, the evening air, and a quiet acknowledgment of a path briefly shared.
