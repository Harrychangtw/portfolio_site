As twilight settles, the city of Taipei dreams under a blanket of clouds. A solitary sentinel, the tower pierces the silent, amber lit sea, a bridge between the sleeping city below and the vast heavens above. Down there, city lights begin to glitter, a gentle cluster of earthbound stars, promising a world that is distant, yet warm.
