<!-- ## About This Collection

This collection explores the geometric patterns, lines, and shapes found in modern urban architecture. Through careful framing and composition, I aim to highlight the mathematical precision and artistic elements present in structures we often pass by without notice.

## The Story Behind the Photos

Walking through cities with a camera forces you to look up, down, and around in ways that daily commuters rarely do. These photographs were taken over a period of six months across several major metropolitan areas. Each image represents a moment where the built environment revealed its underlying design principles.

## Technical Details

All images were shot with a Sony A7III camera paired with a 24-70mm f/2.8 GM lens. I primarily used apertures between f/8 and f/11 to maintain sharpness across the frame, often employing a tripod for the lowest ISO possible. Post-processing was minimal, focusing on contrast adjustment and perspective correction to emphasize the geometric elements.

## Location Notes

The photographs span several locations including New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. Each city offers its own architectural character - from New York's mixture of historic and ultra-modern, to Chicago's pioneering skyscrapers, to San Francisco's unique blend of styles influenced by its geography.
