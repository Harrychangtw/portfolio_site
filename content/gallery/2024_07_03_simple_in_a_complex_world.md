There is a world that hums beneath the noise, a quiet song heard only in the pause.

It is in the sliver of a moon held by wires, a ripple breaking the water's silent face, the vast breath of mountains holding a single silhouette. This is the art of leaving space, not as emptiness, but as room for a thought, a feeling, a moment of pure being.
