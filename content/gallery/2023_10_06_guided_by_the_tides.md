There is a path for us, etched between the shimmering tides. It is a road of liquid light, a way forward into the quiet vastness. Here, with a small hand held in a larger one, they walk not towards a destination, but deeper into a shared silence.

Perhaps life is like this sea, vast and uncertain. Yet, there is always a trail of light, paved by love and companionship. This single moment of togetherness will become the warmest guidance in the countless days to come, a gentle echo on the shores of memory.
