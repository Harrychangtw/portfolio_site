"All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain." The city whispers its own tales, not of distant galaxies, but of fleeting moments on wet asphalt. A lone umbrella against the urban sprawl, fishermen standing against the grey sea, a splash of color from a raincoat in a monochrome world. Each drop of rain is a story, every reflection a memory, all soon to be lost, like tears in the downpour.
