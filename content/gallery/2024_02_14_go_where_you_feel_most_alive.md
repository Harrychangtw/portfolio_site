We travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape us. This collection is a tribute to that pursuit, a series of moments found between the sunrise and the sunset, in the quiet alleys and on the sunlit roads of Tainan and Taichung.

It echoes the sentiment from *The Secret Life of Walter Mitty*: "To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life." Each photograph is a pause, a breath taken to truly see. A reflection in a puddle, the fleeting smile of a stranger, the quiet invitation of an empty chair. These are the fragments of a journey towards feeling most alive.
