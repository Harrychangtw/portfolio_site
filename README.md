# Harry Chang Portfolio Site

A modern, performant portfolio website built with Next.js 15, featuring a dual-domain architecture, custom i18n implementation, file-based CMS, and advanced image optimization. Note: This repository has been deprecated in favor of a new architecture using Turborepo. Check out the new repo [here](https://github.com/Harrychangtw/portfolio-monorepo).

## Key Features

### Dual-Domain Architecture
- **Main site** (`harrychang.me`): Portfolio, projects, gallery
- **Lab subdomain** (`lab.harrychang.me`): Future hub for courses and engaging educational content
- Single codebase with middleware-based routing
- Shared resources (API, images, translations) across both domains

### Content Management
- **Markdown-based CMS** with YAML frontmatter
- Bilingual support (English/Traditional Chinese) via file suffixes
- Dynamic content serving through API routes
- Automated arXiv paper fetching and aggregation
- Template system for quick content creation

### Advanced Image Optimization
- Automated WebP conversion with multiple quality tiers
- Progressive loading with blur-up thumbnails (20px)
- Dimension detection to prevent Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Responsive sizes optimized for different content types:
  - Title/Hero images: 3200-3840px @ 95-98% quality
  - Standard images: 2000-2560px @ 90% quality
  - Thumbnails: 20px @ 60% quality with blur

### Custom Internationalization
- Client-side i18n with React Context (no next-i18next runtime)
- Dynamic JSON translation loading from `/public/locales/`
- FOUC prevention with visibility gating
- HTML parsing for rich text content with links
- Browser language detection with localStorage persistence

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system, Radix UI components
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres) with Prisma ORM
- **Testing**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Image Processing**: Sharp
- **Markdown**: gray-matter, remark, remark-html

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL database (or Vercel Postgres) if intending to setup the lab site

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Harrychangtw/portfolio_site.git
cd portfolio_site

# Install dependencies (runs prisma generate automatically)
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your database credentials and API keys

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# Start development server
npm run dev                 # Main site on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev:lab            # Lab site on http://localhost:3001
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` with the following:

```bash
# Database (Vercel Postgres or local PostgreSQL) This is not needed for the main portfolio site to run
DATABASE_POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:pass@host/db
DATABASE_PRISMA_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host/db?pgbouncer=true&connect_timeout=15

# Spotify API (for now-playing widget)
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
```

## 📝 Content Management

### Adding a New Project

1. Create markdown file: `content/projects/my-project.md`
2. Add frontmatter:
```markdown
---
title: "My Project"
category: "Design"
description: "A brief description"
imageUrl: "/images/projects/my-project/cover.jpg"
date: "2024-11-04"
year: "2024"
pinned: -1        # -1 = not pinned, 1-10 = pin priority (1 = highest)
featured: true
technologies: ["Next.js", "TypeScript"]
---
```
3. Write content in markdown below frontmatter
4. Add images to `public/images/projects/my-project/`
5. Run `npm run optimize-images` to generate WebP variants
6. Commit and deploy

### Adding a Chinese Translation

Create a localized version with `_zh-tw.md` suffix:
- English: `content/projects/my-project.md`
- Chinese: `content/projects/my-project_zh-tw.md`

The system automatically shows the appropriate version based on user language preference.

### Image Optimization Workflow

```bash
# 1. Add original images (JPG/PNG) to public/images/[projects|gallery]/[slug]/
# 2. Run optimization script
npm run optimize-images

# Output: Generates WebP files in public/images/optimized/
# - image.webp (full resolution)
# - image-thumb.webp (20px blur thumbnail)
```

The markdown system automatically converts image paths to optimized versions.

## 🧪 Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev              # Start main site (:3000)
npm run build            # Production build (runs prebuild hooks)
npm run start            # Start production server
npm run optimize-images  # Optimize all images in public/images/
```

### Build Hooks

The build process runs in this order (see `package.json`):
1. `postinstall`: `prisma generate` (generates Prisma Client)
2. `prebuild`: `prisma migrate deploy` + `node scripts/build-papers.mjs` (fetches arXiv papers)
3. `build`: `npm run build`
